Check export in Ridewealth 
Ridewealth check that subscription is set correctly for both stores, ready to go





ok talking about getting an app into native stores through the approval process. if I have iap and give them an email address with an active subscription, say for the next year, that should work for testing and approval

Yes, providing reviewers with an email tied to an active IAP subscription (valid for a year) is a standard, reliable way to get through both Apple App Store and Google Play approval for subscription-based apps.[1][6]

## Apple App Store process

Include test account details in **App Review Information** (under App Store Connect > your app version > App Review Devices).

- List the email/username with active subscription entitlement.
- Exact steps: "Create account via signup screen > purchase Annual Pro subscription using this email: test@example.com (password: testpass)".
- They log in during review; your backend/RevenueCat confirms active status—no sandbox needed for live subs.[4]

## Google Play process

Add under **App content > Content rating** or **Testing** notes in Play Console.

- For IAP apps: "Use test account test@gmail.com (already subscribed to Annual plan, valid through 2027)".
- Testers in internal/closed tracks get free access if internal, but reviewers use production and need real purchase or your active sub credentials.[6]
- New accounts: Still need 12+ testers for 14 days first, but IAP works fine once eligible.[2]

## Pro tips for smooth approval

- **Screenshots/Promo Video**: Show both locked (paywall) and unlocked (post-sub) states clearly.
- **Privacy Policy**: Must link a real policy mentioning subscription data handling.
- **Flutter in-app-purchase**: Ensure RevenueCat or official plugins handle restore purchases gracefully—reviewers test that.
- If rejected: Usually "IAP not functioning" → resubmit with clearer instructions + longer sub validity.

This gets 95% of subscription apps approved on first try since reviewers just need to verify the paywall/sub flow works end-to-end.[1][4]
